# UO-Data-Analysis-Project_1-Video-Game-Marketing

Project Goals:

*What are the most popular consoles and genres for each world region?

*What is the mean critic score for certain publishers/developers? Does this suggest bias in public opinion towards different publishers/developers?

*How has the video game industry changed, and what trends can we pick up on with our sample?


Conclusions:

*The popularity of the Playstation 4 far outstrips other platforms globally.

*Critics seem reluctant to give out scores of less than 8 to games made by Larger, more prominent game Publishers, so there may be some bias going on. 

*Rockstar Games in particular gets consistently highly ranked by critics. Given that they are both the publishers and developers of the GTA series, which is one of the most successful and culturally pervasive games of our time, perhaps that level of influence plays results in critics being biased in favor of them

*Genre preference for game that are being built are key to an era, and that era is defined by the latest technology
